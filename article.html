      <p class="caption">The Begining</p>

            <p>In 1971, the swampy everglades of Kissame Flordia was transformed into what would start as a family park and become the biggest conglomerates of all time.  Walt Disney World opend its glorious doors on October 1st,1971. At the time, it only had one park, the Magic Kindom, with a few rides such as the  Mad Tea Party, Jungle Cruise, It's a Small World, the Hall of Presidents, and the monorail system that attracted people. To gain entry into the park costed no more than a few dollars. Flash forward to 2022 and it is vastly different.  </p>

      <p class ="caption"> The Present</p>

            <p>Stepping through the magical doors of Walt Disney World is not what it once was. Disney has expanded beyond even what Walt, himself, imagend for the park. Since its opening there has been an addition of thre major parks. Through the last decade there has been many additions and renovations within each of these parks to add new rides and to make the parks more intriget. If you decide to setp into the beautful world of Pandora, located in the depth of Animal Kingdom, it is as if you have steped inside the mystical film of Avitar. All these additions have made Disney what it is. However, because of this, they have raised the price of tickets by an exorbitant amount. </p>
